you compilein' my linked-list, clingin' to my cuffs 
you gotta take it down a UML-Diagram, even,  or things'll get rough 
I don't take no UML-Diagram and I don't take no guff 
but I java and I compileeven when it's tough
so I slide, slide, slippity-slide 
and I break boys off, and I  java colorful off
